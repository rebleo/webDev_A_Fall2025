#### init(Final Project)

##### Your final is to create a website using HTML, CSS + JavaScript. It must contain clean + heavily commented code, thoughtful + appealing design and a title. You can use any JS library.

* You will create a concept + wireframe(s) for the different layout of your pages. You must create a webpage that acts as a project proposal slide deck - explains your site + includes relevant details. 

* You can make a site about whatever you want EXCEPT a personal portfolio.

* Your Final Must be a CONTEMPORARY Web Page. This means responsive and using semantic HTML 5. I am not setting a page # requirement, but will be looking for evidence that you put effort into making the most technically + aesthetically sophisticated project you can.

* Original Content - no memes! This should be a portfolio piece you can refer to after you graduate to showcase both your design + technical abilities (image-making is also a skill).
  * A solid concept / idea
  * HTML5 structure with CSS styling
  * CSS - use of classes and IDs
  * Responsive CSS Layout (responsive, flex or grid or Bootstrap)
  * JavaScript Interactivity
  * Thoughtful + Appealing Design
