#### Course Description:
This section of 2193 is an introduction to front end programming through the lens of visual culture. Students are asked to think critically about contemporary imaging + networking tools, techniques and practices while experimenting with interactive media. The semester is scheduled in sequence for an incremental understanding of contemporary web authoring practices. Using the web browser as a creative tool, students will explore responsive web development becoming familiar with: the [unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) command line, Git, Github + Github pages, and the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Students will create and maintain websites that take into consideration aesthetic quality, user experience and technical expertise.

#### Research + Resources:
All materials for this class are open source + can be accessed via this repository and the wiki. Regular updates to the class repo will contain links to starter code gone over during class as well as links to further technical reading. Pick and choose what is of most interest to you - the repo is a jumping off point for your own research + you can always return back to a week to catch up on missed material. Additionally, students will be responsible for citing + discussing their research methods and discoveries with the class.  

* For the majority of the semester students are required to use a grainular tool kit outlined in class. This means leaning on documentation rather than pre-existing code or libraries. 

* Required Text: 
The web is a vast trove of thirty plus years worth of folks thinking they have the answer to yr coding questions. Do not belive everyone you read, nor trust that a code snippet is the be-all solution to yr project. For that reason **[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is the "textbook" for this class and should be your primary resource**. 

#### Readings:
Students will be asked to engage with a variety of texts from the world of art, film, philosophy, technology and
literature. Authors include: Ralph Ellison, Jon Berger, Tim Berners Lee, Shannon Mattern, Marshall McLuhan, Selma Sharif, Susan Sontag,among others. Readings will be assigned weekly, provide by the professor and accessible via the wiki as links or downloadable portable document formats.
