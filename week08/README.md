##### 💾   Pair programming presentation net.art project
###### From Last Week's email:
* Spend time looking through projects on Rhizome's [net.art anthology](https://anthology.rhizome.org/)
* Scroll down to note there are four chapters: 1984-1998, 1999-2004, 2005-2010 & 2011-2016.
* Bookmark or take note of at least three projects that interest you.

##### In class presentations are due Monday November 10th
With your group, choose 1 artwork from the [Rhizome's net.art Anthology](https://anthology.rhizome.org/) to present to the class in a 5-7  minute presentation. Students should share a brief introduction to the artist(s), an explaination of the work and most imporatntly their thoughts on the expirence of the **interactive artwork.**
* You MUST create your [slide deck](https://www.google.com/search?q=slide+deck&oq=slide+deck&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l9.3609j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) using HTML, CSS + JavaSCript. Each slide should be a relative link to another html page or a more sophisticated programatic system if you choose. Use an external styling sheet to keep the styling of your presentation uniform. 
* Your slide deck website must include:
  * A clear wireframe and plan for execution
  * Multiple HTML pages controlled by 1 external styling sheet
  * Flex and Grid Display on some portion of the page/s
  * Some navigation with links to relative file path to go to the next "slide"
  * at least one instance of CSS [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) + one [id](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors)
  * At least five pictures and an "images" or "assets" directory to hold your media. A "pages" or "slides" directory to hold your pages.
* Remember this is a presentation to the class. We should hear from all people in the group on both the response to the artwork as well as the code itself. 
* Please considger making the presentation interactive & inspired by the work you reserached - that's even better!

#### For class on Wednesday:
Research which artwork you would like to present. Discuss with your partners and once you decide post a link to the work by your names [here](https://github.com/rebleo/webDev_A_Fall2025/wiki/Week-08#groups) - link forthcomming. **You can not do an artwork that has been posted by another group!!** 


#### Assignment for Wed
Spend time with the work together and talk about the expirence of looking at it. Make notes - this conversation will lead to your talking points in the presentation. Take screen shots and/or recordings of yourself interacting with the work. If you each have a different experience of the piece - great! Show us and talk about the differences. Not simply "i liked it, s/he didn't" but actually what you each materially experienced on your different screens. 

You will have all of class on Wednesday ot work with your group.
